Description: List.h and List.c is an ADT that works as a doubly LinkedList with nodes that can be inserted into the struct.
Graph.h and Graph.c uses the List ADT and creates a graph using vertices, edges, and arcs.
FindPath.c takes an input file and uses the Graph ADT and prints out the results into an output file.
